\subsection{Team Communication \& Meeting Schedule}
\label{sec:team_comm_meeting}

\textbf{All team communication will take place on our Discord server.}

\medskip

For team meetings, in accordance with our decision to work with two-week sprints which have strict midpoint evaluations halfway through, we have reached the following schedule:

\medskip

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \textbf{Sprint planning meeting:} a 30-45 minute sprint planning meeting at the beginning of every sprint (Monday)
    \item \textbf{Discord text standups:} updates posted to a \verb|#wednesday-updates| Discord text channel every Wednesday at 6pm.
    \item \textbf{Sprint midpoint evaluations:} a 30 minute update on everyone's work, roughly halfway through any given sprint.
\end{itemize}

\medskip

Finally, we have agreed that any member of the team that is currently working on the project should be in our Discord server's voice room.
