\subsection{Software Development Methodology}

After much discussion, our team has elected to move forward with a \textbf{SCRUM software development method with two-week sprints}. To help enforce the precedent that all team members should produce some amount of considerable work week-to-week (to fit in line with team deliverables and check-ups), we will hold midpoint evaluations at the end of the first week of a given sprint (discussed in the section on team communication and meeting schedules -- \ref{sec:team_comm_meeting}).
