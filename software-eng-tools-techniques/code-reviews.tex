\subsection{Code Reviews}

After much discussion, we have elected to implement the following system, considered on a case-by-case basis for issues, with all commits put into pull requests:

\medskip

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \textbf{Minor to moderate non-code changes, minor code changes:} No code reviews necessary.
    \item \textbf{Moderate code changes:} Code review done by one other team member.
    \item \textbf{Major code changes:} Code reviews done by both other team members.
\end{itemize}
